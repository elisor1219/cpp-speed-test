# C++ speed test

This is for testing diffrent functions agins each other.

## How to test

I would recomend to use the `more-structure` folder and go in to `classes` and change the `TestOne.cpp` and `TestTwo.cpp`.
In the files you can put the code you want to test inside the clocks, and any code that you need, but not want to time, can be put before or after the clocks.

## How to run
I would recomed to go into the `more-structure` folder and run `cmake .` followed by `make` and then `./CPP_Speed_Test.out` to run the test. 
This will run the test and output the results to the terminal, as TestOne average time, TestTwo average time and the total time for everything combined.
